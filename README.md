Created an e-commerce application from scratch using HTML,CSS,Bootstrap,JavaScript,JSP.
My projects name is Charlie's Chipmunk Castle.Basically a chipmunk owner who started his own business of selling chipmunk accessories and training/workshop for chipmunks.
The front end of the application is all designed with CSS and bootstrap frameworks.
A user can login/sign up once they enter the application. 
Once the user is in , he/she has the option of purchasing any product they want from the accessories page.
Users can chose the number of items they want and simply click on add to cart. Once they are done shopping,
they can click view cart and see all the selected items they choose with the total prices including tax.
This was a project I created for my web application class. 
When the user clicks on the add to cart, the items are stored in the database and then retreived back when the user views the cart.
I have used Apache tomcat server to deploy and run this application.
