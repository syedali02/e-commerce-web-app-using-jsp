			Charlie's Chipmunk Castle is a family-owned company that was founded by Charles Stafford in 1943. He was an avid 
			outdoorsman who enjoyed spending time with all kinds of animals in the wild.
			One of the most loved were chipmunks. The name chipmunk comes from the "chip-chip"
			sound they make. Charles felt he had much in common with chipmunks. They are very clean
			solitary creatures. When Charles had entered into retirement, he decided to share
			his interest in chipmunks with everyone else. He established Charlie's Chipmunks Castle
			to educate people about chipmunks. Charles discovered that the best way to do this is to 
                        sell products aimed at generating curiosity and interest regarding chipmunks.</p> 
                        
                <p> Charlie's line of products were well-received among his community. He created a new trend of people owning chipmunks 
                        as pets. As more and more people began to own pet chipmunks, Charlie was faced with lots of questions regarding 
                        the care and maintenance of chipmunks. This sparked the idea in Charlie's head to provide training services.
                        We are proud to say that the company has grown to provide training for pet owners along with retail products.</p>  
                        
                <p> Charlie's Chipmunk Castle looks forward to a bright and exciting future for the next upcoming generations of customers.
